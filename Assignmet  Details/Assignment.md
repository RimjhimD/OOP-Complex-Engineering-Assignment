## Assignment Details

### Scenario
For this assignment, you are required to develop an object-oriented application for a business scenario of your choice. Choose a business domain that interests you, such as a caf√©, bookstore, car rental agency, etc. Define the major functionality that your application must provide related to your chosen business.

### Tasks
1. Design an object-oriented application for the chosen business scenario.
2. Write the code for the application using the design.
3. Explain the code with proper design rules and provide justification for design choices.
4. Test at least one method of the application.

### Evaluation Criteria
1. Appropriate model design with proper representation.
2. Correct validation of models with proper justifications.

### Rubrics for Assignment Marking

| Task                      | Criteria                                          | Good (4-5) | Moderate (2-3) | Poor (1) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Class Relationships       | All major classes, relationships, and inheritance have been identified. Demonstrates a clear understanding of OO concepts and how they should be applied to produce a working design. |            |                |          |
| Member Identification     | Most attributes and methods have been identified correctly and placed in correct classes. |            |                |          |
| Functional Specifications| The program has been defined, works, and produces correct results but may not display them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications. Student provides clear justification for design choices. |            |                |          |
| Design Rules              | The code is easy to read, follow, and is well-organized. Some minor design rules or patterns have been broken. Some minor efficiency issues may be present. |            |                |          |

## Submission Guidelines

- Prepare a report for documentation including Design, code, explanation, and test.
- Briefly address the complex problem-solving questions:
  - Does the solution need in-depth engineering knowledge?
  - Does the solution involve wide-ranging or conflicting technical, engineering, and other issues?
  - Is the solution well-known, or does it require abstract thinking and analysis to formulate?
  - Does the solution involve infrequently encountered issues?
  - Does the solution need adherence to standards and codes of practice?
  - Does the solution involve stakeholders with conflicting technical requirements?
  - Does the solution involve interdependence between sub-problems or parts?

## Conclusion

This assignment provides you with the opportunity to apply your knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts in a real-world business scenario of your choice. By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in designing and implementing object-oriented solutions to complex engineering problems.
