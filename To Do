Step 1: Identify the Business Need
The business need for a Capital Banking application is to provide a platform for managing customer accounts, facilitating financial transactions, and offering banking services.

Step 2: Choose a Business Domain
The chosen business domain is banking and financial services.

Step 3: Define Use Cases
Manage Customer Accounts (with admin privilege)
Retrieve Account Information (public/no credentials needed)
Deposit and Withdraw Funds
Transfer Funds between Accounts
Show Account Balance
Generate Account Statements
Find Nearest Branch
Contact Information
Search by Customer Name
Step 4: Identify Classes and Relationships
Main class: CapitalBankingMain (handles program execution)
Parent class: BankAccount (base class for different types of accounts)
Subclasses: SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, etc. (inherits from BankAccount)
Group class: AdminTasks (manages admin privileges; add, subtract, change volume)
Step 5: Create a Class Diagram

Step 9: Test Your Application
Test the application to ensure it performs as expected. Verify that each use case produces the correct results.

Step 10: Document Your Code and Design
Provide documentation for your code, explaining design decisions, class relationships, and usage guidelines.

Step 11: Review and Refactor
Review your code for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. Refactor your code if necessary to improve readability and maintainability.

Step 12: Address Business Requirements
Ensure that your program aligns with the initial business requirements and effectively solves the identified need.

Step 13: Finalize and Deploy
